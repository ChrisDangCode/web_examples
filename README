Examples 1 and 2 are from a website developed in CSCI 4131 - Internet Programming that displays a list of locations that I enjoy.
Example 3 is from an e-commerce clothing site powered by Shopify that I aided in designing.
Example 4 is an educational website developed by myself and a team of three other computer science students as an extra-curricular that was funded by the National Science Foundation.
