Examples 1 and 2 are from a website developed in CSCI 4131 - Internet Programming that displays a list of locations that I enjoy.
Example 3 is from an e-commerce clothing site powered by Shopify that I aided in designing.
Example 4 is an educational website developed by myself and a team of three other computer science students as an extra-curricular that was funded by the National Science Foundation.

The weblink on this github page leads to the code for Examples 1 and 2, listed under the assignments "2" and "3", respectively.

Other examples include some pages I've made as an Internet Operations Specialist for Jostens.

Additionally, I coded up my own portfolio site: https://chris-dang.com/
It is hosted on Github with the domain being handled by 1&1 ionos, and serves as a passion project and test bed for web technologies, such as Javascript and the W3CSS framework.
That github can be found here: https://github.com/RedMaverick00/photo_portfolio
Note! it is largely a work in progress.
